Things to do (in order):
- Refactor the code to make it more reusable for other architectures
	- Break up main function into smaller functions (parse args, preprocess, etc)
	- Add comments to the code
	- Optimize the code
		- Use different regex library
		- General cleanup
- Add support for other architectures (aarch64)
- Add VEX/EVEX support
- Start working on a standard library implementation (for the upstream corrosion project (will be a huge pain to implement in corrosion so implementing in asm for now))
