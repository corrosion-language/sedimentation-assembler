Things to do (in order):
- Refactor the codebase:
  - Figure out what to refactor
- Add support for other executable formats (PE, Mach-O)
- Add support for other architectures (aarch64)
- Add VSIB support (currently the instructions are not supported)
- Start working on a standard library implementation (for the upstream corrosion project (will be a huge pain to implement in corrosion so implementing in asm for now))
